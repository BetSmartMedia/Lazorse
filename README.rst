Lazorse!
========

Lazorse is a web-framework with a strong emphasis on extensibility and
separation of various concerns into independant middleware layers.

It includes middleware to route requests, coerce parameters, dispatch to handlers,
and render a response.  
It borrows heavily from `other`_ `awesome`_ nodejs 
`web frameworks`_ but with a couple of twists designed to make writing 
machine-consumable ReSTful APIs a little easier. Because it's all "just 
middleware", you can also pull out and re-arrange the various pieces to better 
suit the needs of your application.

What's the deal with the name?
------------------------------

While it *could* be viewed as a portmentaeu of Lazy and Resource, I prefer to
think of it as horses with lasers.
