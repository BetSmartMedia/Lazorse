Lazorse is a resource-oriented web-framework with a strong emphasis on
extensibility and the separation of various concerns into independent
middleware_ layers.

It includes middleware to find a resource, coerce URL parameters, dispatch to
HTTP method handlers, and render a response.  

It borrows heavily from other_ awesome_ node.js `web frameworks`_ but with a
couple of twists designed to make writing machine-consumable ReSTful APIs a little easier. Because it's all "just 
middleware", you can also pull out and re-arrange the various pieces to better 
suit the needs of your application.

What's the deal with the name?
------------------------------

While it *could* be viewed as a portmentaeu of Lazy and Resource, I prefer to
think of it as horses with lasers.
