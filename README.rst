Lazorse!
========

Lazorse is a connect middleware stack with a strong emphasis on extensibility
that routes requests, coerces parameters, dispatches to handlers, and renders a 
response. It borrows heavily from `other <zappa>`_ `awesome <coffeemate>`_ nodejs 
`web frameworks <express>`_ but with a couple of twists designed to make writing 
machine-consumable ReSTful APIs a little easier. Because it's all "just 
middleware", you can also pull out and re-arrange the various pieces to better 
suit the needs of your application.

Be sure to check out the walkthrough_ and `API docs`_!

What's the deal with the name?
------------------------------

While it *could* be viewed as a portmentaeu of Lazy and Resource, I prefer to
think of it as horses with lasers.
